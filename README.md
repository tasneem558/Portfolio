# About me

I am Tasneem Mahmoud Rizk, a committed Software Tester and Computer Engineering student at Tanta University, focusing on both manual and automated testing to uphold software quality and reliability. My training at EFG Holding provided me with valuable hands-on experience in testing financial systems, where I also learned to utilize Azure for cloud deployment and integration. Additionally, my time at Apps Square enhanced my skills in testing mobile and web applications. I employ Trello for effective project management and organization.

As a positive thinker, I bring a unique blend of strengths to my work, including strong organizational skills and meticulous attention to detail. My effective communication and collaboration abilities have been honed through my volunteer efforts with the GDSC Tanta team, while my creative problem-solving skills enable me to navigate challenges effectively. I am also driven by an entrepreneurial spirit, currently working on launching my own brand, Allure, which focuses on bags and slippers.

I am passionate about continuous learning and am eager to further develop my skills in automation testing. Through my portfolio, I aim to showcase my projects and demonstrate my dedication to delivering high-quality software solutions. I welcome you to explore my work and connect for potential collaborations or discussions.
